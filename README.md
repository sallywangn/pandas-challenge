The project analyzes data from 15 schools, calculating key metrics such as average math and reading scores, pass rates, etc. These metrics are summarized by various classifications such as school size, type, and student expenditure. The analysis generates multiple summary tables for easier understanding of the schools' overall performance.

This analysis provides a comprehensive view of which schools are performing well and which need improvement across different measures. Breaking the data down by school type, size, and student spending offers a deeper understanding of how these factors affect student achievement and pass rates.

From the analysis of the 15 schools, we found that charter schools have higher math passing percentages, which are all over 90%, and reading passing percentages, which are all over 95%. The overall passing percentages are around 90%. These results are much better than those of district schools.
